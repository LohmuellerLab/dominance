To run full inference on genome-wide SFS data, type:

python2.7 dominance_inference_arabidopsis.py

This estimates:

1) Demographic parameters of a three-epoch model for synonymous SFS from A. lyrata and A. thaliana
2) Parameters of a gamma DFE and parameters of the constant h and h-s relationship model, using 
	2.1) Only the SFS data from A. lyrata
	2.2) Only the SFS data from A. thaliana
	2.3) Both the SFS data from A. lyrata and A. thaliana

Results are written to Excel file "results_table_dominance.xlsx". 
Some basic plotting (comparing observed and expected SFS) is done within the script, but not written to file.
