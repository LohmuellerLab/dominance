To run full inference on genome-wide SFS data:

1) Install dadi: https://bitbucket.org/gutenkunstlab/dadi/
2) Download the "dominance_inference" folder from https://github.com/LohmuellerLab/dominance
3) cd into the folder
4) Run the inference script with python 2.7:

python2.7 dominance_inference_arabidopsis.py

This uses the SFS data in Lyrata_SFS.txt and Thaliana_SFS.txt to estimates:

1) Demographic parameters of a three-epoch model for synonymous SFS from A. lyrata and A. thaliana
2) Parameters of a gamma DFE and parameters of the constant h and h-s relationship model, using 
	2.1) Only the SFS data from A. lyrata
	2.2) Only the SFS data from A. thaliana
	2.3) Both the SFS data from A. lyrata and A. thaliana

Results are written to Excel file "results_table_dominance.xlsx". 
Some basic plotting (comparing observed and expected SFS) is done within the script, but is not written to a file.

For more more details see the inference script "dominance_inference_arabidopsis.py"
